# Oscillating Circuit 🔁 💡

I built a simple astable multivibrator circuit to create an alternating LED flasher. This project was a practical introduction to using transistors as electronic switches and understanding how a capacitor's charge-discharge cycle can be used as a timing element to create an oscillation.
